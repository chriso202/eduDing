## About the Project

eduDing is a mobile app that empowers students to learn and expand their knowledge through the use of various quizzes that contribute to the well being of their very own "Ding". Each Ding has a unique name, style, and emotion, and must be maintained by providing it with food gained by completing a variety of quizzes. Educationally, eduDing primarily focuses on concepts closely related to SAT-prep, but may also be used in many other academic contexts. Download now and make learning fun.
